# //1 TypeDefs
# //type name{} is root of that name query
# //add new operation in schema definition
# One convenient thing about the constructor of the GraphQLServer is that typeDefs can be provided either directly as a string (as you previously did) or by referencing a file that contains your schema definition (this is what youâ€™re doing now).
